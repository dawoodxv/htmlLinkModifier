<p>Social work is a dynamic field that started as a movement to reduce poverty and inequality. In Canada, social work began with a group of home visitors—volunteers driven to help vulnerable people, spread hope and advocate for social justice. Over the past century, social work has evolved into an academic discipline and regulated profession founded on theories of social work, social science and humanities (CASW). In this unit students introduced to the historical context of Social work profession from its early beginning to present day development and what it means to be a professional Social Worker.</p>
<p>This process involves adopting the attitudes, values, knowledge, beliefs, and skills that differentiate social work from other professions. But what does it really mean to say you are a social worker- this unit will lay the ground work to help answer that question.</p>

<p>For early French settlers in Canada , human welfare was considered the responsibility of individuals and families. Where relief was available it was delivered by the Catholic Church through numerous entities operating at the parish level. Services provided to those requiring assistance were differentiated according to distinctions made between the deserving poor and the undeserving poor. Among Anglo-Canadian communities in Quebec, models of charitable provision were similar to those offered by the Catholic Church, except that they tended to be organized and delivered by middle-class and wealthy women through benevolent societies(Ives, Denov, and Sussman, 2015).</p>
<p>In general, the earliest versions of social work took the form of private charities and poor relief.</p>
<ul>
<li>Private charities. An early approach to social work that involved private individuals and religious organizations that provided material relief to the poor.</li>
<li>Poor relief. The “Poor Laws” signaled a progression from private charity toward public welfare, whereby the care and supervision of the poor was the responsibility of each town, village, or hamlet.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1897, at a conference of Charities and Correction in Toronto, Mary Richmond,&nbsp;delivered a paper titled “The Need for a Training School of Applied Philanthropy &nbsp;(Jennisen, 2011). In this presentation, she stated that if those doing social work were to become an effective force in the solution of social problems and the development of community organizations, there was a need for an educational system specifically for social workers. From these beginnings, the professionalization movement gained momentum in the US and Canada, and by 1905, lectures for social workers were under way in Chicago, Boston, and Philadelphia. Several years later, organized social work education began to take place in Canada. While there are many requirements associated professional identity, exactly how they incorporated and understood in each context is unique.</p>
<p>Social work grew slowly during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1926 the Canadian Association of Social Workers was formed, with its first charter members drawn principally from child and family welfare agencies, municipal departments and settlement houses.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(74, 143, 0);"><b>WHAT IT MEANS OT BE A PROFESSIONAL SOCIAL WORKER</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;The CASWE-ACFTS Standards for Accreditation (2014) require schools of social work to support students in “identify[ing] as a professional social worker and adopt[ing] a value perspective of the social work profession.” This process involves adopting the attitudes, values, knowledge, beliefs, and skills that differentiate social work from other professions” (Stokes, 2020). But what does it really mean to say you are a social worker? Of course, there is no single definition. Each social worker understanding of what it means to be a social worker is unique to&nbsp;them.&nbsp; According to the International Federation of Social Workers [IFSW], Social work is a practice-based profession and an academic discipline that promotes social change and development, social cohesion, and the empowerment and liberation of people. Principles of social justice, human rights, collective responsibility and respect for diversities are central to social work (IFSW, 2014).</p>
<p>The understanding of social work’s profession historical development and the attainment of the profession’s Meta competencies enables social workers to feel confident about their ability to practice and provides safeguards for service users who can then trust they are receiving competent services based on accurate and current knowledge in the&nbsp;field (Stokes, 2020).</p>
