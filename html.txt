<p>Codes of ethics unify a profession and at the same time provide assurances of competency to the public. At the centre of social work practice and decision-making in Canada is the Canadian Association of Social Workers (CASW) Code of Ethics (2005). At their core is the development of a professional relationship between the social worker and the service user. Depending on the type of practice and the nature of this relationship, social workers may need to make difficult choices between competing ethical imperatives. Students graduating from an accredited Canadian social work program are expected to demonstrate the capacity to incorporate values and ethical standards into their professional interactions.</p>
<p>This unit introduces students to the guidelines for ethical behavior in social work practice and the development of contemporary ethical standards- the Canadian Association of Social Workers’ Code of Ethics and its six core value. It explores some of the challenges that social workers face in practice and uses examples to illustrate the complexity of ethical choices. Although the core ethical values of social work are introduced in the early stages of social work education and seem relatively simple to understand, at least in theory, the Unit identifies the ongoing challenges and growth of the social work profession. As students progresses through field education and into career pathways, the nuances and complexities of ethical practice become more pronounced.</p>

<p>Ethical behavior lies at the core of every profession. The Canadian Association of Social Workers (CASW) Code of Ethics sets forth values and principles to guide social workers’ professional conduct. Codes of ethics unify a profession and at the same time provide assurances of competency to the public. At the centre of social work practice and decision-making in Canada is the Canadian Association of Social Workers (CASW) Code of Ethics (2005a).This Code of Ethics is consistent with the International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW) International Declaration of Ethical Principles of Social Work (1994, 2004), which requires members of the CASW to uphold the values and principles established by both the CASW and the IFSW. This code provides a framework to ensure that all social workers practice from a core set of values and principles, even though specific areas of practice may vary. The CASW Guidelines for Ethical Practice (2005b), a companion document, provides further clarity on decision-making.</p>
<p>A code of ethics cannot guarantee ethical behavior. Ethical behavior rather comes from a social worker’s individual commitment to engage in ethical practice. Both the spirit and the letter of this Code of Ethics will guide social workers as they act in good faith and with a genuine desire to make sound judgments. Students graduating from an accredited Canadian social work program are expected to demonstrate the capacity to incorporate values and ethical standards into their professional interactions.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(74, 143, 0);"><strong>CORE SOCIAL WORK VALUES AND PRINCIPLES</strong></span></p>
<p><b>Value 1:</b> Respect for the Inherent Dignity and Worth of Persons</p>
<p> Social work is founded on a long-standing commitment to respect the inherent dignity and individual worth of all persons. Social workers recognize and respect the diversity of Canadian society, taking into account the breadth of differences that exist among individuals, families, groups and communities. Social workers uphold the human rights of individuals and groups as expressed in The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1982) and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948).</p>
<p><b>Value 2</b>: Pursuit of Social Justice</p>
<p>Social workers believe in the obligation of people, individually and collectively, to provide resources, services and opportunities for the overall benefit of humanity and to afford them protection from harm. Social workers promote social fairness and the equitable distribution of resources, and act to reduce barriers and expand choice for all persons, with special regard for those who are marginalized, disadvantaged, vulnerable, and/or have exceptional needs. Social workers oppose prejudice and discrimination against any person or group of persons, on any grounds, and specifically challenge views and actions that stereotype particular persons or groups.</p>
<p><b>Value 3:</b> Service to Humanity</p>
<p> The social work profession upholds service in the interests of others, consistent with social justice, as a core professional objective. In professional practice, social workers balance individual needs, and rights and freedoms with collective interests in the service of humanity.</p>
<p><b>Value 4:</b> Integrity in Professional Practice</p>
<p> Social workers demonstrate respect for the profession’s purpose, values and ethical principles relevant to their field of practice. Social workers maintain a high level of professional conduct by acting honestly and responsibly, and promoting the values of the profession. Social workers strive for impartiality in their professional practice, and refrain from imposing their personal values, views and preferences on clients. It is the responsibility of social workers to establish the tenor of their professional relationship with clients, and others to whom they have a professional duty, and to maintain professional boundaries.</p>
<p><b>Value 5:</b> Confidentiality in Professional Practice</p>
<p> A cornerstone of professional social work relationships is confidentiality with respect to all matters associated with professional services to clients. Social workers demonstrate respect for the trust and confidence placed in them by clients, communities and other professionals by protecting the privacy of client information and respecting the client’s right to control when or whether this information will be shared with third parties. Social workers only disclose confidential information to other parties (including family members) with the informed consent of clients, clients’ legally authorized representatives or when required by law or court order.</p>
<p><b>Value 6:</b> Competence in Professional Practice</p>
<p>Social workers respect a client’s right to competent social worker services. Social workers have a responsibility to maintain professional proficiency, to continually strive to increase their professional knowledge and skills, and to apply new knowledge in practice commensurate with their level of professional education, skill and competency, seeking consultation and supervision as appropriate.</p>
