<p style="text-align: left;">Respecting diversity and working with difference is a basic tenet of social work practice. In the course of their daily work, social workers become involved with unique individuals who have very complex personal histories. In addition, they must take into account that not everyone has equal access to social power, life opportunities, and material resources. This unit introduces the many complexities associated with working with and being an ally to people who represent diversity.  Social workers are required to acknowledge the diverse experiences of people, and the intersections of differing self-identities.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Additionally, social workers are required to be self-aware of the conscious and unconscious beliefs and stereotypes they bring into their practice. While it is impossible to be fully competent in all the variability and fluidity associated with identity intersections, this unit will introduce the awareness and acknowledgement of the multiple positions and diverse experiences of individuals and societal structures of oppression and marginalization. It will also emphasizes the principle that social work practice is ultimately about advancing human rights and advocating for social and economic justice.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Social workers are generally required to be self-aware of the conscious and unconscious beliefs and stereotypes they bring into their work. They understand the importance of listening to service users’ experiences of diversity and marginalization, and working with them to ensure equal opportunities, safe and respectful services, and all the benefits of a just society.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Social workers also are aware of diversity in relation to power, privilege, class, wealth, and access to resources. They draw on the broad Social Work knowledge and conceptual base to understand how exclusion, exploitation, and marginalization affect individuals and entire populations in different ways. The Canadian Human Rights Act, which is in line with the principle of Social Work, explicitly prohibits discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, family status, genetic characteristics, and disability (Stokes, 2020).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Cultural competence is crucial to effective and efficient social work practice. Since cultural differences between social workers and their clients can be a barrier to developing a therapeutic alliance, social workers must attain a level of cultural competence that will allow them to engage clients around the work that needs to be done. However, several scholars argue that practicing with competency in respect to diversity and difference can be challenging and somewhat elusive. By applying an intersectional approach to practice, social workers reduce the likelihood of making erroneous assumptions or unfair generalizations (Robinson et al., 2016 Cited in Stokes, 2020).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> While it is impossible to be fully competent in all the variability and fluidity associated with identity intersections, social workers are required to acknowledge the multiple positions and diverse experiences of individuals and societal structures of oppression and marginalization.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The principle Social work practice upholds is ultimately about advancing human rights and advocating for social and economic justice.  While all professions are situated within their larger societal context, social work has a unique and specific obligation to challenge social injustices. According to racial formation theory, race is a socially constructed identity and is situated in social structure (Omi &amp; Winant, cited in Barth et al, 2022). Those in power define groups of people in a certain way that depends on a racist social structure.The CASW code of ethics (2005) upholds the following key value when it comes to advancing social justices “Social workers believe in the obligation of people, individually and collectively, to provide resources, services and opportunities for the overall benefit of humanity and to afford them protection from harm. Social workers promote social fairness and the equitable distribution of resources, and act to reduce barriers and expand choice for all persons, with special regard for those who are marginalized, disadvantaged, vulnerable, and/or have exceptional needs. Social workers oppose prejudice and discrimination against any person or group of persons, on any grounds, and specifically challenge views and actions that stereotype particular persons or groups”. Ethical principles, Value: Pursuit of Social Justice, p.5).</p>
